<h1>The Best Movies According to Kemal Bilge</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Clockwork Orange</h3>
<p> This a a movie of Stanley Kubrick who is one of my favourite director and 
    this movie discuss the goodness and badness of human being and how to approach
    this philosophically.</p>
 <h3>Boyhood</h3>   
 <p>This movie is directed by David Linklater and has been shoten in 
 11 years. It is a story about growing of a boy and this long filming process
 planned intentionally to include exactly the growth of the actor in film.</p>
 <h3>Once Upon a Time in Anatolia</h3>
 <p>This is a movie of Nuri Bilge Ceylan directed in 2011 and won Palme Dor.
 This movie is a good analyse of the people of Anatolia where I was born
 and grow up and for this reason I really like it.</p>
